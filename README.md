# RedesignFigma:Use the UI design principals learned and document your design choices in a README.md file by every category.



I started this project by copying the two pages I want to redesign/reproduce to Figma page.(https://www.templatefreebies.com/resources/food-app-ui-figma).
I createdtwo rectangular frames for my design and to get the sizes,I clicked on the existing home screen(on the left)then under frame i saw what the size is and chose it by hiiting f and selecting the sizes accordingly from the options.I changed the backgroud color as required using an eye dropper and then changed the corner radius using the rounding effect to 15. I entered the text using the icon T and copied and pasted the images as neccessary.
